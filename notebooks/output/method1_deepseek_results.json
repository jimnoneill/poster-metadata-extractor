  "summary": "This research investigates drug-polymer interactions to develop novel drug delivery strategies against antimicrobial resistance using microfluidic-based synthesis of nano-sized carriers. The study found that CURC-loaded PLGA NPs demonstrated better controlled drug delivery due to hydrophobic interactions and showed no cytotoxic effects with progressive cellular internalization.",

Characterization included TEM imaging, size distribution analysis (PDI \u22640.2), zeta potential measurements, and encapsulation efficiency determination.",
  "results": "PLGA NPs: D\u2095 = 61.91 \u00b1 1.86 nm, \u03b6 = 13.74 \u00b1 0.97 mV, EE% = 2.81 \u00b1 0.81%, payload = 2.51 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5g/mg. CURC-loaded PLGA NPs showed slower release rate and better controlled delivery due to hydrophobic interactions. No or slight cytotoxic effect observed on NHDFs with progressive cellular internalization of NPs.",

  "methods": "Custom-built microfluidic device with a Passive Herringbone Mixer (PHBM) chip was used for synthesizing PLGA and PLA/PEG nanoparticles (NPs) via microfluidics. The encapsulation efficiency, physical properties, and release kinetics of curcumin-loaded NPs were analyzed.",
  "results": "NPs had uniform size distribution with PDI <=0.2. Higher encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was observed for curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs compared to PLA/PEG micelles. Curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs showed slower release rates and no or slight cytotoxic effects on NHDFs. The choice of polymer composition played a crucial role in drug-polymer interactions and release kinetics.",

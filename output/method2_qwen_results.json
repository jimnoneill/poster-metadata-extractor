  "methods": "The text does not contain any specific methodological details or experimental procedures related to the influence of drug-polymer interactions on release kinetics of PLGA and PLA/PEG nanoparticles. It appears to be an abstract or introduction section discussing antimicrobial resistance and microfluidic synthesis of nano-sized carriers for drug delivery systems.",
  "results": "The release kinetics of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polylactide-co-ethylene glycol copolymer nanoparticles (PLA/PEG-NPs) were studied in microfluidic devices to understand their influence on drug-polymer interactions. The study aimed to develop novel drug delivery systems that can improve encapsulation efficiency and provide precise control over nanocarrier characteristics.",

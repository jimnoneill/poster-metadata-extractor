  "methods": "The text does not contain any specific methods section. It appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research paper discussing the influence of drug-polymer interactions on release kinetics in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polylactide-co-ethylene glycol diacrylate (PLA/PEG-NPs) nanoparticles. The Methods section would typically detail experimental procedures used in such studies but is absent here.",
  "results": "The study investigates how drug-polymer interactions affect the release kinetics of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and Polylactide-co-Glycolide (PLA)/Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) nanoparticles. The research aims to develop more effective drug delivery systems by optimizing these carrier properties.",

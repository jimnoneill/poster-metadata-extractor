  "summary": "The study investigates the influence of drug-polymer interactions on the release kinetics of PLGA and PLA/PEG nanoparticles (NPs) for controlled drug delivery. Key findings highlight that CURC-loaded PLGA NPs exhibit slower release rates and higher encapsulation efficiency due to hydrophobic interactions, making them suitable for controlled delivery in regenerative medicine.",

  "methods": "Microfluidic-based synthesis was used to prepare nano-sized carriers (PLGA NPs and PLA/PEG micelles) loaded with curcumin (CURC). The NPs were characterized for physical properties, drug loading, and release kinetics. Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity were also evaluated.",
  "results": "NPs had uniform size distribution with PDI \u22640.2. PLGA NPs showed a diameter (D\u2095) of 61.91 \u00b1 1.86 nm and zeta potential (\u03b6) of 13.74 \u00b1 0.97 mV. CURC loading was 2.81 \u00b1 0.81 \u00b5g/mg for PLGA NPs and 2.51 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5g/mg for PLA/PEG micelles. CURC-loaded PLGA NPs exhibited slower release rates and higher encapsulation efficiency. No or slight cytotoxic effects were observed on NHDFs.",

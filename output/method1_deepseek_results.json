  "summary": "The study investigates the impact of drug-polymer interactions on the release kinetics of PLGA and PLA/PEG nanoparticles (NPs) for controlled drug delivery. Key findings highlight that CURC-loaded PLGA NPs exhibit slower release rates and higher encapsulation efficiency, making them suitable for controlled delivery in regenerative medicine.",

  "methods": "Microfluidic-based synthesis was used to prepare nano-sized carriers (PLGA NPs and PLA/PEG micelles) loaded with hydrophobic drug curcumin (CURC). The NPs were characterized for physical properties, drug loading, and release kinetics, with cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity evaluated.",
  "results": "NPs showed uniform size distribution (PDI \u22640.2) with D\u2095 of 61.91 \u00b1 1.86 nm for PLGA and 13.74 \u00b1 0.97 nm for PLA/PEG. CURC-loaded PLGA NPs had higher encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and slower release rates compared to PLA/PEG micelles. No significant cytotoxicity was observed on NHDFs.",

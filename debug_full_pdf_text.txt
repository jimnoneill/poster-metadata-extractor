INTRODUCTION
RESULTS
CONCLUSION
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat'requiring novel drug
delivery strategies (1). Microfluidic-based synthesis of nano-sized carriers for drug delivery
systems (NDDS) offers precise control over nanocarrier characteristics and improves
encapsulation efficiency (2,3).

Rate
•
CURC loaded PLGA NPs were better candidates for controlled drug delivery due
to hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the polymer.
•
No or slight cytotoxic effect of CURC NPs was observed on NHDFs with
progressive cellular internalization of NPs.
•
The choice of polymer composition plays a key role in drug-polymer
interactions and release kinetics to achieve more controlled delivery and
improved therapeutic efficacy in regenerative medicine.

CRITICAL: Look specifically at the BOTTOM/END of the poster text for sections like:
- "Acknowledgments", "Acknowledgements", "Funding", "Support"
- Look for the LAST 800 characters of the text which typically contain acknowledgments

Common patterns in acknowledgments:
‚Ä¢ "We acknowledge...", "The authors acknowledge...", "This work was supported by..."
‚Ä¢ "Financial support from...", "Funded by...", "Grant support from..."  
‚Ä¢ "Thanks to...", "Supported by...", "This research was funded by..."
‚Ä¢ Grant numbers: "Grant No. XXXXX", "Project XXXXX", "#XXXXX"
‚Ä¢ Funding agencies: "NSF", "NIH", "EU", "Horizon 2020", "ERC", etc.

Focus on the END of the text (acknowledgments are usually at bottom of posters):
Text (last 800 chars): "{{text[-800:]}}"

Full text for context: "{{text}}"

Extract specific funding sources, grant numbers, or agencies. List separated by commas.
If no acknowledgments/funding found, return "None found".
